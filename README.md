# Zeus
Rooftop Object Detection

## Introduction
Presented here is a project involving an implementation of a neural network architecture that has the aim of detecting rooftops in a typical 'object detection' task. But why is it called Zeus? For two main reasons; firstly Zeus is the god of the sky and we are detecting rooftops from aerial drone photographs. Secondly, because Zeus was the first god to inhabit Olympus and birth the future gods. This project was my first ambitious AI-related project and I hope like Zeus it will spawn many others that follow in its footsteps. I'm not going to dwell too long on the background, theory, or exact nature of neural networks. Many articles and resources are available for this and my attempt at rehashing this history would not do it justice. Instead, I will focus on the problems I faced with this project and how I overcame them. I find the most useful resources online (especially while attempting this project) were those that focussed on the implementation rather than getting caught up in theory. I will walk through the project and code in chronological order which also closely follows the order of implementation of each component.

WHY? WHY CNNS?

## First Steps
The first step in any project is retrieving the data and then processing it into a state that you can actually work with. The data in this case is from 

---unfinished---
talk about labelling
dependencies and colab
resizing
data split
skipping no-annotations

## Training
training (link to dependencies, GPU)

## Outcomes
results
plotting
embed resulting images
